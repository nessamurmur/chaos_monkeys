# Dirstroyer

Documentation sucks doesn't it? It's really hard to
keep READMEs up to date. It's bad enough when there
are obscure features that aren't documented, but the
worst is when the instructions to get a project setup
are just plain wrong.

Ever seen this?

```markdown
# README

## Installation

Just run script/bootstrap && script/load-seed-data to get started!
```

```bash
# in your terminal

./script/bootstrap
# bunch of output
./script/load-seed-data
# WOAH obscure error about some code you haven't looked at yet!
```

## The Assumption

This is my assumption. It may be totally wrong, but I feel like
often as developers we don't have to set up our own projects often
enough. The setup worked for you when you wrote the README but now
it's been a few months and the code has gone through a lot of changes.

Dirstroyer is meant to disrupt your workflow and keep you on your toes
to make sure your documentation makes sense.
